`MD-TUI` is a TUI application for viewing markdown files directly in your
terminal. I created it because I wasn't happy with how alternatives handled
links in their applications. While the full markdown specification is not yet
supported, it will slowly get there. It's a good solution for quickly viewing
your markdown notes, or opening external links from someones README. If your
terminal support images, they will render.

## Installation

Using cargo: `cargo install md-tui --locked`

On Arch Linux: `pacman -S md-tui`

Prebuilt binaries with install script can be found on the release page.

### Requirements

1. A terminal
2. Nerd font

## Usage

Start the program running `mdt <file.md>` or just `mdt`. The latter will search
recursively from where it was invoked for any markdown file and show it in a
_file tree_.

## Key binds

| Key              | Action                                                                 |

## Syntax highlighting

`MD-TUI` supports syntax highlighting in code blocks for the following
languages:

- Bash/sh
- C/C++
- Elixir
- Go
- Java
- JavaScript
- Json
- Lua
- Ocaml

## Configuration

The program checks for the file `~/.config/mdt/config.toml` at startup. The
following parameters and their defaults are written below. Setting color to `""`
will not remove it, but leave it as its default. To remove colors, set it to
`reset`.

```toml
# General settings
width = 100

# Inline styling
bold_color = "reset"
bold_italic_color = "reset"
code_bg_color = "#2A2A2A"
code_fg_color = "red"
italic_color = "reset"
link_color = "blue"
link_selected_bg_color = "darkgrey"
link_selected_fg_color = "green"
strikethrough_color = "reset"

# Block styling
code_block_bg_color = "#2A2A2A"
quote_bg_color = "reset"
table_header_bg_color = "reset"
table_header_fg_color = "yellow"

# File tree
file_tree_name_color = "blue"
file_tree_page_count_color = "lightgreen"
file_tree_path_color = "gray"
file_tree_selected_fg_color = "lightgreen"
gitignore = false

# Quote bar
quote_caution = "lightmagenta"
quote_default = "white"
quote_important = "lightred"
quote_note = "lightblue"
quote_tip = "lightgreen"
quote_warning = "lightYellow"

# Heading
h_bg_color = "blue"
h_fg_color = "black"
h2_fg_color = "green"
h3_fg_color = "magenta"
h4_fg_color = "cyan"
h5_fg_color = "yellow"
h6_fg_color = "lightred"
```

## Links

MD-TUI currently supports `[text](url)`, `[[link]]`, and `[[link|Some title]]`
type of links.

## Neovim plugin

This application also exists as a plugin for Neovim called
[Preview](https://github.com/henriklovhaug/Preview.nvim).

> [!NOTE]
>
> This version does not support images regardless of your terminal capabilities.
